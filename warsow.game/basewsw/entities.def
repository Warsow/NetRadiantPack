WORLDSPAWN ENTITY

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
Only used for the world.
-------- KEYS --------
message : text to print at user logon. Used for name of level.
music : path/name of looping .wav file used for level's music (eg. music/sonic5.wav).
ambient : Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
_color : RGB value for ambient light color (default is 0 0 0).
_keeplights : Keep light entities in the BSP. Normally stripped out by the BSP process and read from the .map file by the lighting phase (Warsow needs this to be set to 1!).
gridsize : granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
_blocksize : q3map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Default _blocksize value is 1024. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density.
gravity : gravity of level (default is normal gravity: 800).
colorCorrection : path to the default global color correction LUT for the level.*/

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.
In Warsow, "wait" will be understood only as delay for spawning the item once the map starts. Respawn item times depend on the gametype and can't be selected by the mapper.

-------- NOTES --------
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. Pendulums always swing north / south on unrotated models. Add an angles field to the model to allow rotation in other directions. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity.*/

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ? LOW_TRIGGER
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. (updated: 12/08/2005)
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast the plat moves (default 300).
accel : default 20
deccel : default 20
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 8).
height : if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat, instead of being implicitly assigned by the model's height.

gametype : list of gametype names in which this entity will be spawned.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOW_TRIGGER : &1 the plat is triggered from its lower side
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

NOROTATE : disables rotation
-------- NOTES --------
Both the setting "angles" key or "targeting a target_position" methods can be used to aim the camera. However, the target_position method is simpler. In both cases, the "roll" key must be used to set the roll angle. If either the SLOWROTATE or FASTROTATE spawnflag is set, then the "roll" value is irrelevant.*/

This is used to give ammo, weapons, health or items to the player who activates it.

a) automatically give items to players when they spawn in the game: make a spawn location entity like info_player_deathmatch or CTF respawn points target this entity, then make it target the item(s) to give to the player upon respawn.
b) give items to players during the game: make a trigger_multiple target this entity, then make it target the item(s) to give to the player when the trigger is touched.*/

/*QUAKED target_speaker (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) LOOPED_ON LOOPED_OFF RELIABLE GLOBAL ACTIVATOR
Normal sounds play each time the target is used.  The reliable flag can be set for crucial voiceovers. Looped sounds are always atten 3 / vol 1, and the use function toggles it on/off. Multiple identical looping sounds will just increase volume without any speed cost. (updated: 12/08/2005)
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
volume : 0.0 to 1.0
attenuation : -1 = none, send to whole level, 1 = normal fighting sounds, 2 = idle sound level, 3 = ambient sound level
wait : delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see Notes).
targetname : the activating button or trigger points to this.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notduel : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes. 
gametype : list of gametype names in which this entity will be spawned.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : &1 sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : &2 sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
RELIABLE : &4
GLOBAL : &8 Overrides attenuation setting. Sound will play full volume throughout the level as if it had attenuation -1
ACTIVATOR : &16 sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.*/
